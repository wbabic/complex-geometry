* Introduction to complex
** draw graphs of the complex plane
*** lines and circles
    equations and formulas
*** regions
    unit disk
    upper half plane 
*** grids
    rectangular
    polar
    elliptic hyperbollic
*** roots of unity

*** circles and radial lines
**** 24 fold
     15 degree increments
     15 30 45 60 75 90
     times 4
     reflect x
     reflect y
     r = 1
     as r -> 0
     as r -> infinity
     theta -> 
     pi  half quarter eigth
         third sixth twelth
     a twentyfourth of tau
     a twelth of pi
*** ellipses and hyperbolas
*** the complex exponential function
** draw into html canvas using clojurescript
   complex.cljs
   geometry.cljs
   
** org-mode export to display equations
   use org mode to export equations
   to isert template with export options:
   C-c C-e t  ->  org-insert-export-options-template
